Cleaning anonymous data collected by Survey Monkey

- Created a script that runs through Survey Data and cleans it for analysis. 
- Data delivered via excel with over 17000 entries from 198 respondents. 
- Created visualizations to examine question order bias
- The idea for the analysis came from [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/eliminate-order-bias-to-improve-your-survey-responses/)
