# Survey Monkey Data Cleaning and Order Bias Analysis

- While practicing cleaning and transforming data using some anonymous data from Survey Monekey, I came across another use for this data.

- The idea for the analysis section came from a blog post on [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/eliminate-order-bias-to-improve-your-survey-responses/)


**RESULTS**

In this single survey there seems to be a small amount of bias to answering the questions with answers 4-7. If the Survey is designed on a Likert scale, the normal distribution might be off, looking at the low amount of total responses for answer 3. This distribution of responses may be acceptable due to the number of respondents(198). Depends on the industry standard for question and answer bias.
